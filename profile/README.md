### What

Prima provides the reference implementation of Powell's derivative-free optimization solvers,
namely COBYLA, UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, and LINCOA.

This package is part of a research project funded by the
[Hong Kong Research Grants Council](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc) and
the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk) (PolyU).
It is still **under intensive development**, and there is no release yet. If you want to use the
above-mentioned solvers, see the [website](https://www.pdfo.net)
and [repository](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo) of PDFO instead.

Dedicated to late Professor [M. J. D. Powell](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html) FRS (1936--2015).

### Why

The goal is to implement these solvers in modern languages ---
first [**modern** Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org) (F2003 or newer), and then MATLAB, Python, and
probably Julia and R. It will be a faithful implementation, in the sense that the new code will be
mathematically equivalent to Powell’s, except for the
[bug fixes](#bug-fixes) and improvements that we make intentionally.

The focus is to implement Powell’s solvers in a **structured** and **modularized** way so that they
are **readable**, **maintainable**, and **extendable**. The new code will have no GOTO (of course)
and will use matrix-vector procedures instead of loops whenever possible.

### How

The mission is nontrivial due to the delicacy of Powell's algorithms and the unique style of his
code.  We started the Fortran code by refactoring Powell's code into the free form via a small
[MATLAB tool](https://github.com/equipez/prima/blob/master/matlab/setup_tools/freeform.m) written
by ourselves. However, such refactored code is far from what we want, because it inherits completely
the structure and style of Powell's code except for the layout. Extensive modifications are needed
to reorganize (indeed, to **rewrite**) the code. To maintain the faithfulness and quality of our
implementation, intensive tests are conducted after each and every tiny modification, the test
problems coming from the [CUTEst set](https://github.com/ralna/CUTEst). The tests do not only verify
the faithfulness of our implementation, but also check that **the solvers behave properly even if they
are invoked with improper inputs or encounter failures of function evaluations**.

The tests are automated by
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). As of September 2022, more than
25,000 "workflows" have been successfully run by GitHub Actions
(see https://github.com/equipez/gitpersonal/actions and https://github.com/equipez/prima/actions).
Normally, each workflow consists of \~ 5 **randomized** tests
that are conducted in parallel, each test taking from tens of minutes to several hours (the maximum
is 6 hours, after which the workflow will be canceled automatically). In other words, our
implementation has been verified by more than $10^5$ hours (or more than $10$ years) of randomized tests.

### Bug fixes

This modernized reference implementation has fixed the following known issues in the **old Fortran
77 implementation**.

Note that all the issues are problems in the Fortran 77 code rather than flaws in the algorithms.
The examples given below are bugs or requests sent to [NLopt](https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt), a
package providing a C version of COBYLA, NEWUOA, and BOBYQA based on the **old Fortran 77
implementation**. The C code in NLopt is translated from the Fortran 77 code straightforwardly, if
not automatically by [f2c](https://netlib.org/f2c/f2c.pdf), and hence inherits the style, structure,
and probably bugs of the old Fortran 77 implementation.

- The solvers may crash with segmentation faults due to uninitialized variables that are used as indices.

- The solvers may get stuck in infinite loops.

- COBYLA may not return the best point that is evaluated; sometimes, the returned point can have a
large constraint violation even though the starting point is feasible.
